	 * The danger here is of a stale page_mapping() return value
	 * indicating a struct address_space different from the one it's
	 * associated with when it is associated with one.
	 * After smp_mb(), it's either the correct page_mapping() for
	 * the page, or an old page_mapping() and the page's own
	 * page_mapping() has gone NULL.
	 * The ->sync_page() address_space operation must tolerate
	 * page_mapping() going NULL. By an amazing coincidence,
	 * this comes about because none of the users of the page
	 * in the ->sync_page() methods make essential use of the
	 * page_mapping(), merely passing the page down to the backing
	 * device's unplug functions when it's non-NULL, which in turn
	 * ignore it for all cases but swap, where only page_private(page) is
	 * of interest. When page_mapping() does go NULL, the entire
	 * call stack gracefully ignores the page and returns.
